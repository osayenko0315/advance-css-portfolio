# advance-css-portfolio

I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch.

## Task Completed
* Site is divided into several sections About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
* I included functioning navigation links.
* Included coming soon projects 
* The page was styled for multiple screen sizes.
* I also included some on hover effects for the various links.

## Links
* Link to code repository https://github.com/osayenko0315/advance-css-portfolio

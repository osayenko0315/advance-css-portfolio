##Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

I wrote the HTML and CSS for a sample professional portfolio which will be added to over time to become my own personal portfolio of work. I used what I have learned in the first two weeks of the bootcamp to write the HTML and CSS from scratch, while keeping in mind the following requirements:

* Site is divided into several sections About Me, My Work, and Contact Info.
* I included functioning navigation links.
* Included coming soon projects 
* The non-placholder applications will take the user to the deployed application on my GitHub when clicked on.
* The page was styled for multiple screen sizes.
* I also included some on hover effects for the various links.
